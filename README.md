How to dress? function is connected to ChatGpt and generates data per request.  
## Testing
   run: ```php artisan test --filter WeatherApiTest tests/Feature/WeatherApiTest.php ```


## If I would have more time
- Login modal + google/apple auth
- Limit the number of request per minute 		
- Take in consideration the country (some cities has same/similar names)
- Fahrenheit  option  
- Scheduler to automatically update the weather
- More testing (frontend, api requests, create data)
- Refresh previous requests
- Send the How to dress? response generated by ChatGpt to my personal email every morning.
